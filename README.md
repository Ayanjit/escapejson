This is built to escape JSON data or unescape JSON string. Fully client-side.<br />
Hosted : https://escapejson.bybob.cc

Code is written by GitHub Copilot only.

For some debugging purpose I had to unescape JSON strings multiple times.
All the online sites have too many ads, do decided to build one.

To run locally :
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
